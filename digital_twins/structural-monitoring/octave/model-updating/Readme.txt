This codes conducts model updating based on the sensitivity approach with modal features inferred 
from vibration measurements. In the main file, "Input_Upd", the user must provide input and execute 
the code. The output of the code is a file (saved in the folder "Results") containing the updated 
mass, damping, and stiffness matrices along with information on the output DOF and the modes used 
in the model updating. 

The user must, in the command window, specify the modes to use in the updating during the run of the 
code. This can be based on a figure showing the modal assurance criterion (MAC) values and the modal 
complexity factors (MCFs) that will appear during the run.
