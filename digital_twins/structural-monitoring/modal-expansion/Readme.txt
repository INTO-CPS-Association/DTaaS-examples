This codes conducts virtual sensing based on modal expansion with mode shapes from a physics-based model.
In the main file, "Input_ModExp", the user must provide input and execute the code. The output of the 
code is a file (saved in the folder "Results") containing the estimates of the displacements in all the 
degrees of freedom in the model.

The user must, in the command window, specify the eigenmodes to use in the expansion during the run of 
the code.
