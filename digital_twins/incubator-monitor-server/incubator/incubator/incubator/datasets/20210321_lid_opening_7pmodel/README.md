## Results and Discussion

This dataset was used for the calibration of the SevenParameterIncubatorPlant model.
The calibration itself is still a work in progress, as we probably need to have a more controlled experiment, using possibly a sensor embedded in the object inside the incubator.

But the dataset was good enough to show how the SevenParameterIncubatorPlant nicely incorporates the open lid dynamics.
